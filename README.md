# 9 Days of JavaScript 🚀

Welcome to JavaScript Learning Journey! Over 9 days, I built 9 practical projects to master core JavaScript concepts — from variables and DOM basics to working with APIs and async programming.  
Each project is beginner-friendly, fully functional, and focused on practicing real-world JavaScript skills.

---

## ⚡️ Why I Did This

I wanted to strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals, practice DOM manipulation, work with APIs, and build the habit of shipping small, complete projects daily.


## 📅 Projects Overview

## 📖 Project Details

---

###  Day 1: About Me Info Card

A simple interactive info card built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays your name, age, favorite quote, and hobbies dynamically using variables and DOM manipulation.

## 💡 What I Learned
- JS Variables & Data Types
- Template Literals
- Basic DOM Manipulation (getElementById, innerText)
- Simple styling with CSS

---

###  Day 2: Age Eligibility Checker

This app checks if a user is eligible to vote, drive, or drink based on age input. Uses real-time input, conditionals, and DOM feedback.

## 💡 What I Learned
- JS Conditionals (if/else)
- querySelector & value
- addEventListener
- Array.push, join
- .textContent to show results

---

### 🎮 Day 3: Guess the Number Game

A fun game where you guess a random number between 1 and 100 within 5 tries. The app gives feedback if your guess is too high or too low.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Math.random(), Math.floor()
- Loops & Conditional Logic
- DOM Manipulation (innerText, value)
- Event Handling (addEventListener)
- Basic Game Logic

---

### 📐 Day 4: Simple Calculator

A fully functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This calculator performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), supports parentheses, percentage, square, and square root operations — all with a clean, responsive UI.

## 💡 What I Learned
- **JavaScript Functions** — helper functions for clear, delete, calculate, square, square root.
- **Event Handling** — `onclick` handlers for button clicks.
- **DOM Manipulation** — `getElementById` & `.value` to update display.
- **JS Built-ins** — `eval()` for expression calculation (with caution).
- **Input Validation** — basic checks for safe input.
- **Clean UI Design** — CSS Grid, hover states, modern look.

### 🎬 Day 5: Movie Card Generator

A mini movie card UI that dynamically displays movie details from an array of objects. Like a mini Netflix grid!

## 💡 What I Learned
- Arrays & Objects
- Looping through data
- Dynamic DOM Creation
- Template Literals
---

### 😂 Day 6: Joke Generator (API)

A web app that fetches a random joke from an external API when you click a button. Includes a CSS loading spinner for better UX.

## 💡 What I Learned
- fetch() API & JSON parsing
- Promises with `.then()`
- Async DOM updates
- Error Handling
- CSS Spinner Animation

---

### 🌓 Day 7: Theme Changer

A light/dark mode toggle using JS and CSS. Remembers your choice with localStorage.

## 💡 What I Learned
- classList.toggle()
- DOM Event Handling
- localStorage for theme persistence

---

### 🗒️ Day 8: To-Do List App

A simple but functional To-Do app where you can add, mark complete, and delete tasks. Data persists with localStorage.

## 💡 What I Learned
- document.createElement, appendChild
- Event Delegation with e.target
- Class Toggling with .classList
- localStorage: setItem, getItem

---

### 🔍 Day 9: GitHub User Finder

# GitHub User Finder

Search for any GitHub user by username. Displays profile info like avatar, location, followers, and public repos. Uses the GitHub API.

## 💡 What I Learned
- async/await with fetch()
- ES6 Destructuring
- Error Handling (try/catch)
- Clipboard API
- Responsive Layout (Flexbox, Media Queries)

---

## 🏁 Next Steps

✅ Each project will be:
- 📂 In its own folder with `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`.
- 📑 Documented with this README.
